![Untitled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67241239/95659592-eb2ff580-0ad6-11eb-8865-b7738c04907e.png)

## Description
A quick bot I made as a joke for a few friends. Type '!sus' then anyones name (or technically anything for that matter) and it will give a brief description of how sus they are. Practically speaking functions like an 8-ball at this point.
## Commands
```sh
!susbot sus [insert name here]
```
This command will place blame on whoever you put after the sus command.

```sh
!susbot task
```
This will automatically generate an excuse for getting rid of blame instantly.(not all excuses are accurate use at your own risk)
