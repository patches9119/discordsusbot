## Description
A quick bot I made as a joke for a few friends. Has a few set of commands seen below. Requires read and write access to any channel you would like to use it in. Currently on version 0.2.1.
## Commands
```sh
!susbot sus [insert name here]
```
This command will place blame on whoever you put after the sus command.

```sh
!susbot task
```
This will automatically generate an excuse for getting rid of blame instantly.(not all excuses are accurate use at your own risk)

```sh
!susbot vote [option1],[option2],[option3],...
```
This command will return a random option and tell you what to vote for.

```sh
!susbot help
```
This will display a list of all availible commands.
